# Strawx Engine

The Engine is under Development...

Include ``engine.h`` in your main file and define the Start, Update and Render methods provided by the ```Engine``` Class.

``` CPP
#include "strawx/engine.h"

using namespace strawx;

// called once
void Engine::Start() {

}

void Engine::Update(float dt) {

}

void Engine::Render() {

}
```
